The wizard's spellbook is hidden.
Never underestimate the power of chaos.
Quantum physics makes my head spin.
The cake is definitely not a lie.
Beware of the smiling cat in the dark.
Magic portals open at midnight.
Dragons hoard more than just gold.
The encrypted message remains a mystery.
Shadows whisper secrets in the wind.
A time traveler once warned me about this.
